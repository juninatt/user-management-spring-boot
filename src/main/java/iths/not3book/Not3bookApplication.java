 *
 * Is set up for PostgreSQL and uses Spring Data JPA to interact with the database.

 * in order for authenticated users to interact with the database.
 * {@link iths.not3book.author.Author}
 * {@link iths.not3book.subscriber.Subscriber}
 * {@link iths.not3book.document.Document}
 * {@link iths.not3book.contactinfo.ContactInformation}

 * containing information about the error is sent back with the response.
 * {@link iths.not3book.exception.GlobalExceptionHandler}
 * {@link iths.not3book.exception.ResourceNotFoundException}
 * {@link iths.not3book.exception.ErrorResponse}
